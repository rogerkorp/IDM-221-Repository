# IDM-221 Content Preperation
## Inspiration Documentation

- I like how the navigation is oriented vertically instead of the usual horizontal header. I think that by doing this slight layout change it made the site seem memorable to me.
- While the palette is simple, it doesn't use pure white or black. It instead uses a softer version of the two colors which looks easier on the eyes despite thier stark contrast.
- The animations on the site are pleasent, but there are no signifyers to indicate how the interactions work. This is especially problematic on the side bar, in which some interaction reveal a slick dropdown menu, while others link to an entirely new page.
- The website design is a bit too plain, but it at least looks professional. 
- I think that the typography looks nice. It establishes a clear content hierarchy.
- The blank space on the right edge looks weirdly unbalanced. 
- I enjoy the way that his research is presented, especially in combination with his website. The boring website makes the content more exciting since it's not fighting for your attention.

- I like how nearly every project on the site is accessible from the site itself. Especially the games. It helps maintain continuity quite well when you don't have to redirect to a third party website.
- I like how the web banner looks. The use of gifs and images makes the website just look far more interesting by providing splashes of colors while *also* showcasing the creators work.
- The accolades looks weird with how they're staggered, plus they're pretty deep down on the About Me page.
- They mention making rapid prototypes and work on UI/UX design, but I don't see any of that featured on the website.
- The photography centric website seperating the game design content from the photography content sounds like a good idea because the bio doesn't focus on photography at all, but the link is dead.

- Seperating the content with sloped lines has made the design far more visually interesting than just a column, while still achieving a clear reading order.
- Content is a bit claustrophobic though, and the text on the images can be a bit hard to read at times.
- Micro-interactions on the website are pretty well animated, and I think the transitions are pretty smooth. Overall, I think this helps contribute to the strong personality of the website.
- I like how it's able to be fun and interesting to look at while still maintaining its professionalism.

## About Me

I’m a quirky UI, UX, and Graphic Designer originally from the lovely coastal city of Newburyport, MA. As a full-time student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA, I’m currently perusing a Bachelor of Science in Interactive Digital Media. 

In my spare time, I love to exploring works from the talented artists and designers that are around me. I often find myself visiting the local museums, catching a movie at a nearby theater, or sometimes I simply take a walk in the park. When I’m creating, I often like to express my ideas through designing, crafting, drawing, writing, and photography. During the school week, I dedicate my time to my work. I develop user interfaces, prepare oral presentations, compose research reports, and occasionally I work on an art project or two. 

For my current work, I rely on my trustworthy MacBook Pro and the Adobe Creative Cloud. I mainly use Photoshop, Illustrator, and XD, however, I am also competent in using Fireworks, Dreamweaver, and Premiere. In addition, I also have significant experience with digital tools such as Processing, CREO Parametric, and the Microsoft Office family of applications.

I love what I do, and the reason why is simple: I find joy in expressing my ideas! I’m always thinking about concepts and stories that excite me, and I’m always interested in taking risky moves and breaking the norms. I work hard to create a world where my wildest dreams can exist, turning my own wishes into a reality.

I hope you enjoy looking through my portfolio, and if you would like to contact me feel free to send me an email. I’ll reply to you as soon as I possibly can.
